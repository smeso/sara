menuconfig SECURITY_SARA
	bool "SARA"
	depends on SECURITY
	select SECURITYFS
	help
	  This selects SARA LSM which aims to collect heterogeneous
	  security measures providing a common interface to manage them.
	  This LSM will always be stacked with the selected primary LSM and
	  other stacked LSMs.
	  Further information can be found in
	  Documentation/admin-guide/LSM/SARA.rst.

	  If unsure, answer N.

config SECURITY_SARA_DEFAULT_DISABLED
	bool "SARA will be disabled at boot."
	depends on SECURITY_SARA
	help
	  If you say Y here, SARA will not be enabled at startup. You can
	  override this option at boot time via "sara.enabled=[1|0]" kernel
	  parameter or via user-space utilities.
	  This option is useful for distro kernels.

	  If unsure, answer N.

config SECURITY_SARA_NO_RUNTIME_ENABLE
	bool "SARA can be turned on only at boot time."
	depends on SECURITY_SARA_DEFAULT_DISABLED
	default y
	help
	  By enabling this option it won't be possible to turn on SARA
	  at runtime via user-space utilities. However it can still be
	  turned on at boot time via the "sara.enabled=1" kernel parameter.
	  This option is functionally equivalent to "sara.enabled=0" kernel
	  parameter. This option is useful for distro kernels.

	  If unsure, answer Y.
